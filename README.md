# SilentiumChat Client

🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧

SilentiumChat Client is the front-end application for **SilentiumChat**, a secure messaging app with **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**.  
All messages are encrypted on the client side — the server only relays encrypted data and never has access to your messages or private keys.

## Features (planned)

- Client-side encryption and decryption
- Minimal interface for sending/receiving messages
- Key management and identity handling
- Future: group chats, attachments, notifications, etc.

## Status

⚠️ This project is still under active development.  
Expect frequent updates, changes, and new features.
